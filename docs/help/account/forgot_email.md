If you're having trouble logging in and do not remember your email to login or you're not sure which email is assigned to your account, you will need to use <b>"Forgot email"</b> on the login page.

:::info
This feature is only available in version 1.8 and up.
:::

Once you are on the <b>"Forgot email"</b> page, type in your username that you use for the app. Once you do that and request recovery, you will receive an email on the email that is assigned to that email account. If you do not receive an email, then it's either in spam, it's on an email you've forgotten about or you orignally had a typo in your email. If it's not in spam and you cannot find the email for recovery, then unfortunately we will not be able to help you. In order to recover an email, you need to have access to the email the account is registered under.
