Privacy Buckets are a feature to allow you to finetune who of your friends can see what. You can assign buckets to your content (members, custom fronts, custom fields, groups) and you can assign buckets to your friends. When you have a bucket assigned to certain content such as the member "**Amber**" having assigned the "**Trusted Friends**" bucket, and you then assign the "**Trusted Friends**" bucket to a friend of your choosing, that friend will have access to **Amber**, and anything else you assigned the "**Trusted Friends**" bucket to.

You can assign as many buckets to your content as you want, there's no limit to how many buckets you can have or can assign to content. Same with friends, you can assign as many buckets as you want to your friends.
