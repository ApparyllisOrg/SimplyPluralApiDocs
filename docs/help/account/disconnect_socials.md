This cannot be undone, once you unlink a social login and move to a email and password login, you cannot reconnect your social login
:::

If you are logging in with socials (Google, Apple), and you wish to convert your account to a normal password account, please request a password reset.

This will send you a link to reset your password which will set the password for your account and unlink you from social logins.

This means you will need to login with email and password from there on.
