If you are logging in and you are prompted with a username selection, even though you already setup an account, you are logged into the wrong account or you or someonone in your system deleted your account.

To recover your account use the [forgot email](/docs/help/account/forgot_email) feature to be reminded what email is associated with that username. As stated on the support page for forgotten emails, if you are not receiving an email then it's either in spam, an email you forgot about or you originally had a typo in your email address.

If you requested an email for your account, but never received any for the reasons above then unfortunately we cannot recover your account. Even if you were to contact us on our email, we won't be able to help. We can only make changes to accounts when the support emails come from the emails associated with an account. It's the only way we can verify ownership of an account.
