In order to recover your account, please use <b>"Forgot password"</b> and <b>"Forgot email"</b> on the login page.

If you know what email your account is registered under, but you do not have access to that email, then you cannot receive a reset for your password.
To change the email associated to your account, you will need to login to the app and know the password to your account, then in <b>"Account Settings"</b>, you can change your email associated to your account.
If you do not know the password to your account and you do not have access to your email account, you cannot recover your account.

If you are still logged in to your account on another device and you wish to backup your data, you can connect your account with PluralKit to export your members. If you want to recover the front history and custom fronts, you can create a <b>"User Report"</b> by going to Settings -> Account -> User Report. Once you create a user export, make sure to save it as a PDF so you have a copy of the data.
