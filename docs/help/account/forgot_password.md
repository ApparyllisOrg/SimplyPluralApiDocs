If you forget your password to your account, you will need to press <b>"Forgot Password"</b> on the login page.

Type in your email address and an email will be sent to your account to reset the password. If you do not receive an email, it is either in spam or there is no account under that email.

If you originally signed up with a typo in your email, you will not be able to reset your password and you will need to remember your Simply Plural password.
