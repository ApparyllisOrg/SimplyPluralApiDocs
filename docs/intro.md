Simply Plural is an app designed for plural systems.
Keep up to date with who fronts when, store data about yourselves in your member profiles and keep notes per member.

Our app is designed with privacy and security first. We use Google Firebase to store our data, so your data is securely uploaded to the cloud. We have strict security rules that disallow any access to any data unless you specify that that member can read that data.

You can share who is currently fronting with family and friends, optionally with notifications. As well as sharing your members with friends and family.
