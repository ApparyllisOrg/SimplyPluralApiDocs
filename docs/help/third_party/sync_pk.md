If you wish to sync your members to PluralKit, go into the settings page -> <b>Integrations</b> -> <b>PluralKit</b> and fill in your PluralKit token, you can get this token by typing pk;token anywhere in a PluralKit enabled Discord server and PluralKit will message you the token in a DM.

Once filled out, you can go to actions in the members page and press <b>"Sync"</b> (rebooting app may be required to see this option after adding the token). You will be prompted with the option to <b>"Sync to PK"</b> and <b>"Sync from PK"</b>.

Pay attention that they are linked by the PluralKit ID found in the individual member settings in Simply Plural. If you make a member on Simply Plural and you make the same member on PluralKit, you will have to go into the individual member settings of Simply Plural and fill in the PluralKit user ID in the settings. If you don't do this, you will end up with duplicate members on PluralKit.

:::info

Your PluralKit token is only ever stored on your local device, you need to re-add your token every time you logout and on every device independently.
